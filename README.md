## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS- all custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

I learned that, when dealing with implementation of CRUD, it is way better to implement the logic first- like the functions/operations, before proceeding with the design. In doing so, all I needed was to call the ready-made functions to integrate into design. Not the other way around. I shall take that into consideration FIRST thing for future projects.

### Continued development

I am looking to implement animated sorting of arrays. This feature shall be added soon.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - I consulted the docs for using features such as mixins, partials, etc.
- [Deploying Vite to GH Pages](https://dev.to/shashannkbawa/deploying-vite-app-to-github-pages-3ane) - Helped me deploy my Vite App to GH Pages. Worth checking out!
- [Vite - Getting Started](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Very EASY-to-follow to scaffold a React project really fast.
